A simple web application that predicts a random winner for the English Premier League.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design
- A central card with a button to trigger the prediction.
- The predicted winner is displayed below the button.
- A clean and simple design.
- **Day and Night Mode**: The application will support both day and night themes, allowing users to toggle between them.
- **Singapore Flag Background**: A Singapore flag image will be used as the background for the application, scaled to cover the entire viewport.

### Features
- Predicts a random Premier League winner from a predefined list of teams.
- A "Predict Winner" button to generate a new prediction.

## Current Task: Add Background Image

### Plan
1.  **Manual Image Download**: User needs to manually download a Singapore flag image (e.g., `singapore-flag.png`) and place it in the `assets/images/` directory.
2.  **Modify `style.css`**: (Completed) Added CSS rules to the `body` selector to display the Singapore flag as a background image, covering the viewport and centered.
